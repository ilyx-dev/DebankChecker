# üöÄ Debank Checker

## üîç Overview

DeBank Checker is a tool written in TypeScript for mass analysis of crypto wallets on the DeBank service. It bypasses all DeBank protections (429, x-headers, etc.) and parses data about tokens in networks and liquidity pools with subsequent saving to excel table in a convenient form. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

* **Proxy Support**: Works with http/https proxy in format `http://user:pass@ip:port`
* **Asynchronous & Concurrent**:  Uses asynchronous programming based on Promise and [p-limit](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-limit) for maximum speed
* **Customizable Filtering**:  Filter tokens displayed in the output based on their minimum value in dollars.
* **Excel Export**:  Export collected data to a structured Excel spreadsheet.
* **Open Source & Modular**: Written in TypeScript with a clean, object-oriented structure for easy customization and extension.
